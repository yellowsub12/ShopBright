# SOEN-341 - ShopBright E-Commerce Store

## Objective

Develop an Amazon-like e-commerce website.

## Description
2020 was the start of a new decade and it was defined by the beginning of the COVID-19 global crisis. Due to the social distancing rules, people had to turn towards online shopping to procure daily necessities and various other products. This website will alow users to buy their everyday products from the comfort of their home or anywhere around the world and at any time of the day with just one click. Shoppers will be able to save time by not having to travel to a store to pick up their purchase since everything will be shipping to their address. 


## Core Features

For our e-commerce website to succeed, it must possess several core features that are paramount to the user's shopping experience. Among these core features, we will develop a website that will allow the user to browse items on display, add products to a shopping cart and also go through a checkout process to make orders. The website admin will have a distinct user page that will allow them to add, remove, or edit products displayed. The user will navigate through items displayed, and can see their details when chosen. Once a user adds an item (of any quantity) to a cart, they will be able to edit the quantity of it as well and remove it if needed.

Finally, once the user is ready, they can then check out to a payment page where they will make the purchase (all fees calculated automatically) and the order will be displayed on the user's page, from where it can also be cancelled.
